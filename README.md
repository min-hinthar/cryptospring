# Crypto Spring

Crypto Spring is a Web3.0 NFT marketplace web application that allows users to create, buy, sell and resell unique digital assets on the blockchain. This project is inspired by the Burma Spring Revolution Civil Disobedience Movement and aspires to provides a safe environment for supporters of the Movement to create, showcase, buy, sell and resell NFTs that represent their support for the Movement, donate funds for humanitarian aid/assistance and receive rewards for their creativity and participation. Users can browse through various categories of NFTs, such as art, music, gaming, sports, etc., and filter them by price, popularity, rarity, etc. Users can also create their own NFTs by uploading their files, setting their metadata, and minting them on the blockchain. Users can also bid on NFTs, make offers, accept or reject them, and view their transaction history. Crypto Spring also supports voice control using Alan AI, which enables users to interact with the app using natural language commands.

Crypto Spring is a project that demonstrates how to build a Web3.0 NFT marketplace web app using Solidity and Next.js. Solidity is a programming language for writing smart contracts that run on the Ethereum blockchain. Next.js is a React framework for building fast and scalable web applications. Crypto Spring uses Hardhat to test and deploy smart contracts, Metamask to authenticate users and interact with the blockchain, Tailwind CSS to style the app, Context API for state management, and Alan AI for voice control.

## Features

Crypto Spring has the following features:

- Users can create NFTs that showcase their solidarity with the Burmese people, such as art, music, photos, videos, etc.
- Users can buy and sell NFTs on the marketplace, and resell them for a profit or a loss.
- Users can donate funds to the movement using ETH or other cryptocurrencies, and receive NFTs as tokens of appreciation.
- Users can view the progress and impact of the movement, such as the number of supporters, funds raised, actions taken, etc.
- Users can use voice control to interact with the platform using natural language commands.

## Installation

To install this project locally, you need to have Node.js (version 14 or higher), npm (version 6 or higher), and Metamask installed on your machine. You also need to have some ETH and some test tokens in your Metamask wallet. You can get some ETH from a faucet like [Rinkeby] or [Kovan]. You can get some test tokens from the `mint.js` script in the `scripts` folder.

Follow these steps to install this project:

1. Clone this repository using `git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/Crypto-Spring.git`.
2. Navigate to the project folder using `cd Crypto-Spring`.
3. Install the dependencies using `npm install`.
4. Compile the smart contracts using `npx hardhat compile`.
5. Deploy the smart contracts to a local network using `npx hardhat node`.
6. Copy the contract address and ABI from the terminal output and paste them in the `config.js` file in the `src` folder.
7. Run the web application using `npm run dev`.
8. Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:3000`.

## Usage
